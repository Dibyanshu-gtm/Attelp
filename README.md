# Attelp
Attelp is my web development project which is based on the simple idea of helping students and teachers to take and monitor their attendances.

It was a part of my college project where we had to design a website that actually helps in the regular functioning of daily school/college life. The major modules that are used in this project is basically HTML,CSS,PHP and some bit of JSON as well.
It is really an intresting project for me. I have also used Chart.js implementation in this project which is licensed ny MIT(Check js directory for the Chart.min.js file and the related license details) .

For proper working  just use the following steps
1) Download all the files and store it in your Web Server Solutions based on Apache(e.g XAMMP) in a directory called as htdocs.
2) Now open your localhost phpmyAdmin and then import the att.sql file in a created database named 'att'.
3) Now you can add students , teachers or any subjects through this  myAdmin.
4) You are ready to take off !!!!!!
